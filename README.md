# City Generator 2.0

### A Fully Random Procedural City Generator

The 2.0 version of an old project I made in js back in my Graphics University Course: [Old Project](https://github.com/JonMallozzi/COS420-FinalProject-CityGenerator)

The new goal is to get a fully working web game written completely in Rust that supports WebGL and Webgpu.

#### Tech
* Leptos for the Frontent
* WGPU for the game
